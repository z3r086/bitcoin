/**
 * Transaction reconciliation is a way for nodes to efficiently announce transactions.
 * This object keeps track of all reconciliation-related communications with the peers.
 * The high-level protocol is:
 * 0. Reconciliation protocol handshake.
 * 1. Once we receive a new transaction, add it to the set instead of announcing immediately
 * 2. When the time comes, a reconciliation initiator requests a sketch from the peer, where a sketch
 *    is a compressed representation of their set
 * 3. Once the initiator received a sketch from the peer, the initiator computes a local sketch,
 *    and combines the two skethes to find the difference in *sets*.
 * 4. Now the initiator knows full symmetrical difference and can request what the initiator is
 *    missing and announce to the peer what the peer is missing. For the former, an extra round is
 *    required because the initiator knows only short IDs of those transactions.
 * 5. Sometimes reconciliation fails if the difference is larger than the parties estimated,
 *    then there is one sketch extension round, in which the initiator requests for extra data.
 * 6. If extension succeeds, go to step 4.
 * 7. If extension fails, the initiator notifies the peer and announces all transactions from the
 *    corresponding set. Once the peer received the failure notification, the peer announces all
 *    transactions from the corresponding set.
 *
 * This is a modification of the Erlay protocol (https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10518) with two
 * changes (sketch extensions instead of bisections, and an extra INV exchange round), both
 * are motivated in BIP-330.
